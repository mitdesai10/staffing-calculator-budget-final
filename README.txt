💰 BUDGET CALCULATOR - MARGIN RANGE FEATURE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

✅ NEW: MARGIN RANGE INSTEAD OF SINGLE TARGET!

BEFORE (Single Target):
Target: 55%
All positions aim for ~55% average

NOW (Range):
Target: 55% - 60%
Positions distributed within range:
- Position 1: 55.3% ✓
- Position 2: 57.8% ✓
- Position 3: 59.1% ✓
- Position 4: 56.2% ✓
Average: ~57% (within range!)

UPLOAD ALL 6 FILES:
==================
1. index.html  (margin range inputs)
2. styles.css  (range styling)
3. script.js   (range calculation logic)
4. sheetsConfig.js
5. sheetsLoader.js
6. rateCardData.js

HOW IT WORKS:
============

BUDGET ENTRY:
┌────────────────────────────────┐
│ Annual Budget: $2,179,800      │
│ Positions: 8                   │
│                                │
│ Target Margin Range:           │
│ Min: [55] to Max: [60]        │
│                                │
│ [Set Budget & Start Adding →]  │
└────────────────────────────────┘

CALCULATION:
1. User sets range: 55-60%
2. Add all 8 positions
3. Calculator assigns margins within 55-60%
4. Respects location caps:
   - Onshore: max 60%
   - Offshore: max 95%
   - Nearshore: max 40%
5. Uses 100% of budget

EXAMPLE RESULTS:
===============

Range: 55-60%
8 Positions Mixed Locations

Onshore (55-60% range, 60% cap):
- SF Architect: 57.2% ✓
- Marketing: 58.9% ✓
- Release Mgr: 55.8% ✓

Offshore (55-60% range, 95% cap):
- Junior Dev: 59.3% ✓
- QA Team: 56.1% ✓

Nearshore (40% cap overrides range!):
- Data Arch: 38.5% ✓ (40% cap applies)
- Integration: 39.2% ✓ (40% cap applies)

Average: ~57.5% (within range!)

LOCATION CAPS OVERRIDE RANGE:
=============================

If range is 55-60% but location is nearshore:
→ Nearshore max is 40%
→ Calculator uses 10-40% for nearshore
→ Other locations use 55-60%

If range is 30-40% and location is offshore:
→ Calculator uses 30-40% for offshore
→ Even though offshore cap is 95%

SMART LOGIC:
- Range cannot exceed location caps
- Calculator picks narrower limit
- Always respects both constraints

ALL FEATURES:
============
✅ Margin range (not single target)
✅ Location-based caps (60%/95%/40%)
✅ 100% budget utilization
✅ Position limiting
✅ Discount feature
✅ Smart warnings
✅ Pending status

EXAMPLES:
========

Example 1:
Range: 50-55%
Budget: $2M
8 positions

Result:
- All margins between 50-55%
- Average: ~52.5%
- Uses full $2M

Example 2:
Range: 60-70%
Budget: $5M
5 positions (3 onshore, 2 offshore)

Result:
- Onshore: 60% (capped!)
- Offshore: 60-70% ✓
- Average: ~64%
- Uses full $5M

Example 3:
Range: 55-60%
Budget: $3M
10 positions (mix)

Result:
- Each position: 55-60%
- Realistic distribution
- Average: ~57.5%
