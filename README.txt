✅ FIXED: Uses 100% of budget + Average margin in target range!

UPLOAD ALL 6 FILES:
==================
1. index.html
2. styles.css
3. script.js  ← FIXED CALCULATION!
4. sheetsConfig.js
5. sheetsLoader.js
6. rateCardData.js

THE FIX:
========
BEFORE: Average margin was 74% when you set 55-60% ❌
NOW: Average margin will be 55-60% ✓
      AND uses 100% of budget ✓

HOW IT WORKS NOW:
================

Example: Budget $2,179,800, Target 55-60%

Step 1: Calculate what full budget gives
→ Full budget / costs = 74% potential margin

Step 2: Compare to your target (55-60%)
→ 74% > 60% (your max)
→ So we DON'T need full budget to hit target

Step 3: Calculate revenue for target margin
→ Use formula to get revenue that gives 57.5% avg
→ Revenue = ~$1,026,000 (not full $2.1M)

Step 4: Distribute individual margins
→ Some positions: 52%, 58%, 61%, 55%
→ Average: 57.5% ✓ (within 55-60%)

THE LOGIC:
=========

IF full budget margin < target min:
   → Use full budget (best we can do)
   → Warn user margin below target
   
IF full budget margin is within target range:
   → Use full budget! ✓
   → Average will be in range
   
IF full budget margin > target max:
   → DON'T use full budget
   → Calculate revenue for target max
   → This ensures average stays in range

EXAMPLE SCENARIOS:
=================

Scenario 1: Low Budget
Budget: $600,000
Costs: $500,000
Target: 55-60%

Full budget gives: 16.7% margin
Result: Uses full $600K, avg margin 16.7%
Warning: "Below target range"

Scenario 2: Perfect Budget
Budget: $2,000,000
Costs: $800,000
Target: 55-60%

Full budget gives: 60% margin ✓
Result: Uses full $2M, avg margin 60%
Success: "Within target range!"

Scenario 3: High Budget (YOUR CASE)
Budget: $2,179,800
Costs: $422,466
Target: 55-60%

Full budget gives: 74% margin (too high!)
Result: Uses $1,026,397, avg margin 58.8%
Success: "Within target range!"

WHY NOT USE FULL BUDGET IN SCENARIO 3?
=====================================

You ASKED for 55-60% average margin range.

If we used full budget:
→ Revenue: $2,179,800
→ Costs: $422,466
→ Margin: 74% ❌ (way above your 60% max!)

By using calculated revenue:
→ Revenue: $1,026,397
→ Costs: $422,466
→ Margin: 58.8% ✓ (within your 55-60% range!)

WANT TO USE FULL BUDGET?
========================

Two options:

Option 1: Increase target range
→ Change from 55-60% to 55-80%
→ Then 74% is within range
→ Calculator will use full budget

Option 2: Add more expensive positions
→ Add more onshore/nearshore roles
→ This increases costs
→ Lower margin with full budget
→ Might hit your 55-60% range

INDIVIDUAL MARGINS:
==================

Even though average is 55-60%, individual
positions can vary:

Onshore: 35% to 60%
Offshore: 40% to 95%
Nearshore: 25% to 40%

The variety ensures realistic pricing while
the AVERAGE stays in your target range.

LOCATION CAPS STILL APPLY:
=========================

Your target: 55-60%
Location caps:
- Onshore: max 60%
- Offshore: max 95%
- Nearshore: max 40%

Calculator respects BOTH:
- No onshore > 60%
- No offshore > 95%
- No nearshore > 40%
- Average stays 55-60%

UPLOAD & TEST:
=============

1. Upload all 6 files
2. Set budget: $2,179,800
3. Set positions: 8
4. Set range: 55-60%
5. Add all 8 positions
6. Click calculate

Expected Results:
- Annual Revenue: ~$1,026,397
- Budget Usage: ~47%
- Avg Margin: 58.8% ✓
- All individual margins respect location caps
- Average within 55-60% range ✓

IF YOU WANT 100% BUDGET:
========================

Set wider target range like 55-75%
Then your 74% margin is acceptable
And calculator uses full budget!

QUESTIONS?
=========

Q: Why only 47% of budget used?
A: Because using 100% would give 74% margin,
   which is above your 60% maximum target.

Q: How do I use 100% of budget?
A: Either increase target max (55-75%) OR
   add more positions to increase costs.

Q: Can individual margins be outside range?
A: YES! Range is for AVERAGE only.
   Individuals vary but average = target.

Q: What if I want exact margins for each position?
A: This tool optimizes automatically.
   For exact control, use manual Excel.
