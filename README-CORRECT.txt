💰 BUDGET CALCULATOR - CORRECT VERSION!

✅ NOW CORRECT: Use FULL budget + Average margin 55-60%!

THE STRATEGY:
============
Use VARIED individual margins to balance the average:

- Offshore (high margin): 85-95%
- Onshore (medium): 35-58%
- Nearshore (low): 25-38%

Average: 55-60% ✓
Budget: 100% used ✓

EXAMPLE FROM YOUR SCREENSHOT:
============================
Role                        Location    Margin
------------------------------------------------
SF Solution Architect      Onshore     52% ✓
Marketing Cloud            Onshore     59% ✓
Commerce Admin             India       92% ✓
Junior Developer           India       95% ✓
Release Manager            Onshore     38% ✓
Data Architect             Onshore     39% ✓
QA x2                      India       30% ✓

HIGH margins (India 92%, 95%) balance LOW margins (38%, 39%)
Average: ~58% ✓ (within 55-60%)
Budget: 100% used ✓

HOW IT WORKS:
============
1. Calculator uses FULL budget as revenue target
2. Assigns strategic margins:
   - Offshore: HIGH (85-95%) to pull average up
   - Onshore: LOWER (35-58%) to pull average down
   - Nearshore: LOWEST (25-38%)
3. Scales all positions to use exactly full budget
4. Result: 100% budget + 55-60% average ✓

LOCATION CAPS STILL ENFORCED:
============================
- Onshore: Max 60%
- Offshore: Max 95%
- Nearshore: Max 40%

UPLOAD ALL 6 FILES:
==================
1. index.html
2. styles.css
3. script.js ← KEY FIX!
4. sheetsConfig.js
5. sheetsLoader.js
6. rateCardData.js

EXPECTED RESULTS:
================
Budget: $2,179,800
Target: 55-60% avg margin
8 positions

Output:
- Annual Revenue: $2,179,800 (100%! ✓)
- Offshore margins: 85-95%
- Onshore margins: 38-58%
- Nearshore margins: 28-38%
- Average: 56-59% ✓

THIS IS THE CORRECT LOGIC! 🎯
