# 🎯 Budget-Based Staffing Calculator - Updates

## ✨ New Feature: Target Average Margin Range

### What Changed?

The calculator now supports **margin range targeting** instead of a single minimum margin. This gives you more control over your pricing strategy!

### 🆕 New Functionality

#### Before:
- Single target margin (e.g., 55%)
- Calculator tried to maximize margins above this minimum
- Less predictable final average margin

#### After:
- **Margin range** (e.g., 55% - 60%)
- Average margin will be **within your specified range**
- Individual positions can still vary between 10-65%
- More predictable and controlled pricing

### 📊 How It Works

1. **Set Your Range**: Enter min and max margin (e.g., 55-60%)
2. **Add Positions**: Add all positions with their costs
3. **Smart Calculation**: 
   - Each position gets individual margin (10-65%)
   - Average across all positions = **within your target range**
   - Example: With 55-60% target, final average might be 55.5%, 57.2%, 59.8%, etc.

### 💡 Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Budget allows high margins**
- Budget: $3,000,000
- Costs: $1,000,000
- Target Range: 55-60%
- Result: Average margin will be **60%** (max of range)
- Revenue: ~$2,500,000

**Scenario 2: Budget requires lower margins**
- Budget: $2,000,000
- Costs: $1,000,000
- Target Range: 55-60%
- Result: Average margin will be **~50%** (below range due to budget constraint)
- Warning shown: "Average margin below target range"

**Scenario 3: Perfect fit**
- Budget: $2,400,000
- Costs: $1,000,000
- Target Range: 55-60%
- Result: Average margin will be **58.3%** (within range!)
- Revenue: ~$2,400,000

### 🎨 UI Changes

**Start Page:**
```
Target Average Margin Range (%)
[Min: 55] - [Max: 60]
Average margin will be within this range. Individual positions can vary (10-65%).
```

**Budget Card:**
```
Target: 55-60% avg margin
```

### 🔧 Technical Details

**Algorithm:**
1. Calculate total costs
2. Determine target average margin based on:
   - Your specified range (e.g., 55-60%)
   - Available budget
   - Cost constraints
3. Assign random individual margins (10-65%) to positions
4. Scale revenues to achieve target average margin
5. Clamp individual margins to 10-65% bounds

**Key Constraints:**
- Individual position margins: Always 10-65%
- Average margin: Targets your specified range
- Budget: Used efficiently to meet margin targets

### 📝 Files Updated

1. **index.html**
   - New margin range inputs (min/max)
   - Updated UI labels and descriptions
   
2. **script.js**
   - New global variables: `minTargetMargin`, `maxTargetMargin`
   - Updated `handleSetBudget()` function
   - Completely rewritten `calculateRatesAndMargins()` algorithm
   - Better logging and validation

3. **styles.css**
   - New styles for margin range inputs
   - Responsive layout for range controls

4. **rateCardData.js**
   - Fixed malformed JSON (duplicate data removed)
   - Cleaned up backup data structure

### 🚀 Usage Example

```javascript
// User inputs:
Budget: $2,800,000
Positions: 8
Margin Range: 55% - 60%

// Result:
Average Margin: 57.3% ✓ (within range!)
Individual margins:
- Salesforce Architect (Onshore): 62.4%
- Marketing Specialist (Offshore): 89.3%
- Developer (Onshore): 58.1%
- QA (Offshore): 71.5%
... etc
```

### ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Individual margins can exceed your range** - Only the AVERAGE needs to be in range
2. **Budget vs Margin trade-off**:
   - If budget is too high → Average margin hits max of range
   - If budget is too low → Average margin may go below range
   - Sweet spot → Average margin within range
3. **All positions must be added** before calculation runs
4. **Discount feature** still works - applies after rate calculation

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed duplicate data in rateCardData.js
- Improved margin constraint enforcement
- Better console logging for debugging
- More accurate budget utilization

### 📦 Deployment

Simply replace your existing files with these updated ones:
- index.html
- script.js
- styles.css
- rateCardData.js (optional - fixed backup data)
- sheetsConfig.js (no changes)
- sheetsLoader.js (no changes)

No database changes or additional dependencies required!
